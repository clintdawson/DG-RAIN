# DG-RAIN
This suite of codes models rainfall runoff and coastal inundation in a two-dimensional coastal watershed.  It includes models of
overland flow through 1D kinematic equations, 1d Channel flow, coupling of channel networks, and interaction of channels with 2D coastal bays.
The author of the code is Prapti Neupane and description of the models can be found in the Ph.D. thesis:
"Advances Towards a Multi-Dimensional Discontinuous Galerkin Method for Modeling Hurricane Storm Surge Induced Flooding in Coastal Watersheds"
The University of Texas at Austin, 2016.
